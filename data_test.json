You do not have to caramelize the onions; you can melt the butter in your crockpot, stir in the onions to coat, add the remaining ingredients, and cook.

Cook, stirring constantly, until onions are soft and caramelized, at least 30 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.\nStir sherry into onion mixture; scrape the bottom to dissolve the small bits of browned food. Transfer onions into a slow cooker and pour in beef broth. Season with sea salt; stir in thyme and bay leaf. Cover and cook on Low for 8 to 10 hours or on High for 4 to 6 hours.\nPreheat the oven broiler about 10 minutes before serving. Set an oven rack about 8 inches from the heat source.\nArrange bread slices on a baking sheet; broil until toasted, 1 to 2 minutes per side.\nLightly toss Gruyere, Emmental, Parmesan, and mozzarella cheeses in a bowl. Fill oven-safe soup crocks 3/4 full with onion soup and float a bread slice in each bowl. Top each with about 2 tablespoons cheese mixture.\nPlace filled bowls onto a baking sheet and broil until cheese topping is lightly browned and bubbling, about 2 minutes.\n\nMichael Di Roma\n   Tips  \n\nIf you like, put all the soup components \u2014 soup, toasted bread, and cheese mixture \u2014 out on the table and let people make their soup!

Increase mixer speed to medium-high and continue whipping until meringue is thick and shiny, an additional 3 to 4 minutes.\nUse a spatula to spread meringue over the entire pie all the way to the crust. Toast meringue under the hot broiler until lightly brown, 1 to 2 minutes.\nServe chilled or at room temperature.\n\n\n\n\n   Cook's Note:  \n\nYou can use a blow torch to toast the meringue, if you have one.",

Char siu literally means \"fork roast\" and refers to the traditional method of cooking this dish by which strips of seasoned pork were skewered with long forks and roasted in a covered oven or over a fire. This version uses pork tenderloin and is easy to make at home on your charcoal grill. Enjoy the sweet and salty taste on its own or serve it over rice or noodles.",
        "ingredients": "\u00bd cup soy sauce\n\u2153 cup honey\n\u2153 cup ketchup\n\u2153 cup brown sugar\n\u00bc cup Chinese rice wine\n2 tablespoons hoisin sauce\n2 tablespoons red bean curd (Optional)\n1 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder (Optional)\n2 (1 pound) pork tenderloins",
        "instructions": "Stir soy sauce, honey, ketchup, brown sugar, rice wine, hoisin sauce, red bean curd, and five-spice powder together in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook and stir until just combined and slightly warm, 2 to 3 minutes.\nMeanwhile, slice each pork tenderloin lengthwise into 1 1/2- to 2-inch-thick strips. Place pork strips in a large, resealable plastic bag.\nPour marinade into the bag with the pork. Squeeze air from the bag, seal, and turn the bag a few times until pork is well coated. Marinate in the refrigerator, 2 hours to overnight.\nWhen ready to cook, preheat a charcoal grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.\nRemove pork from marinade and shake to remove excess liquid. Set aside the remaining marinade for basting.\nRake the hot coals into two equal piles on opposite sides of the charcoal grate. Add a small container of water to the grate. Place pork strips in the center of the grate for indirect cooking.\nCook pork over indirect heat, turning regularly and basting as desired, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), 30 minutes or longer.\n\n\n\n\n   Tips  \n\nIf you can't find red bean curd, use 1/2 teaspoon red food coloring instead, if desired.\n\n\n\nTo cook over indirect heat on a gas grill, simply turn off the center burner. Place food over that burner and it will cook by the heat on either side.\n\n\n   Editor's Note:  \n\nThe nutrition data for this recipe includes the full amount of marinade ingredients. The actual amount of the marinade consumed will vary.",
